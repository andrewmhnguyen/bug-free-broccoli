When setting the nodes for the second bot we chose to do 1, 100, 150, and 500

For the first round, we got 7 draws, 58 wins for the first bot, and 35 wins for the second bot.
For the second round, we got 3 draws, 42 wins for the first bot, and 55 wins for the second bot.
For the third round, we got 2 draws, 39 wins for the first bot, and 59 wins for the second bot.
For the fourth round, we got 0 draws, 39 wins for the first bot, and 61 wins for the second bot.

Overall, we can see that as we increased the number of nodes for the second bot, the better the bot 
would be. This makes sense as it'd be able to explore more and go deeper, maybe giving a more optimal
path compared to less nodes. I think there might be a bias towards the second bot as even when the 
nodes were even it still tended to win more albeit not by much.
