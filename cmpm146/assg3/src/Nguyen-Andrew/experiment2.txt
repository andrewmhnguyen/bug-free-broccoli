There is more that I didn't paste for the modified 1000 vs vanilla 1000
The modified 1000 have a higher win rate against vanilla 100 but not too much than modified 1000 vs vanilla 1000.
It is possible that our modification did not really have a significant influence to the Alogrithm
We changed  changed the exploration factor
if we win it explores less to exploit
and if not then we explore more
