When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It  contains all of Spielberg's magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful ca mera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over techn ology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc.  and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I've seen with great acting by children. S pielberg's camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles  to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs' 'interaction' with the characters. Aside from tech nical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of na tural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema b eing one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of  the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times  throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of th e dinosaurs is wonderfully developed.

It has a sleek, very modern sense of style-just watch fo r how each rule makes it's appearance/reappearance and a good message on the importance of others in  the worst of times.

True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and wa s a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as a rtistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It  contains all of Spielberg''s magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful c amera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over tech nology).

anguy224-> (1, 5, 8, 'This movie is a solid action movie. Not all of the dialogue is great and some  of the effects are a bit dated - but this movie is still effective. The acting is great. The plot is  great. This movie is well-shot and worth watching. I can''t really come up with many things that ar e bad about it that don''t have to do with it being old. This is just a fun movie with good action,  time travel, and robots. I''d definitely recommend this movie. Its worth watching if you''re looking  for a good time.'),
anguy224-> (2, 7, 8, 'This film was a fun ride all the way through. It''s lack of scariness(non exis tent) and *GASP!* gore is more than made up for with the constant flow of hilarity and likable chara cters. This is by far the optimist''s zombie film, as the way things play out are definitely differe nt than any one thats come before it(definitely not a Romero flick, though I think his Land of the D ead actually is second place in this regard). It has a sleek, very modern sense of style-just watch  for how each rule makes it''s appearance/reappearance and a good message on the importance of others  in the worst of times. I recommend this to anybody who has a remote interest in comedies, zombie/en d of the world flicks, or just having a good time at the theater, and look forward to seeing it agai n when it comes out.'),
anguy224-> (3, 6, 10, 'There aren''t many movies better than Ghostbusters. This film expertly balanc es itself right between the horror genre and the comedy genre. The chemistry of the main three chara cters is undeniable, and when you throw in interesting side characters (such as Rick Moranis as Loui s Tully), every scene is a delight to watch. The story is original, the effects are impressive and t he jokes are funny - in short, Ghostbusters is a timeless classic.'),
anguy224-> (4, 2, 10, 'I sat in a packed yet silent theater this morning and watched, what I believe  to be, the next Academy Award winner for the Best Picture. I''m not at all a fan of war movies but  I am a fan of great movies....and 1917 is a great movie. I have never been so mesmerized by set desi gn and direction, the mass human emotion of this film is astonishingly captured and embedded magical ly in the audience. It keeps running through my mind...the poetry and beauty intertwined with the ra w misery of war. Treat yourself....see this movie!'),

Jude Law and Robert Downey Jnr both are great  as Watson and Holmes, as well as Stephen Fry is a very funny Microft. But then, there are some big  mistakes in casting. Noomi Rapace is The biggest blunder. She was great in The Swedish Girl Who... T rilogy, but here no. She is weak, pale, blunt, shallow and gray. T
