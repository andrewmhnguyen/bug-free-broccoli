-------------------------
What did you learn in this lab?
I learned more about the AND/NAND gates and the OR/NOR gates.
More specifically, I learned more about the uses of NAND and NOR
gates and how they can be used to form the other logic gates. 
Finally, I learned how to use MultiMedia Logic as it was my first 
time using this software.

What worked well? Did you encounter any issues?
Overall, the lab worked fairly well. I did not know how to use 
MultiMedia Logic initially because I tried using the tutorial but 
it was not working on my laptop. Instead, I had to look up online 
the basics of MML.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would try to make it more clear the criteria on certain aspects of the lab, 
especially the comments needed on the lab. I did not know how specific I needed
to be when I was making my comments on the circuits and my comments on when I was
describing the output of each part.
