What were the learning objectives of this lab?
The learning objectives of this lab was to teach us how to manipulate bits and
binary information. In addition, it also teaches more about 2s complements and 
switching the number by inverting it. Also taught us about multiplexors and their
uses.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I was stuck on the 2Cs part or where you inverted the number for a very long time.
Luckily, after reading through a piazza post I figured out what I needed to do in 
order for the lab to work. 
Finally completing the lab and seeing all the parts working was enjoyable.


How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
I would add more information on what to do. I feel like the lab sheet itself just 
throws you in there and without prior information you can't figure out where to 
start or what to do. For me, once I had a little bit of inspiration, figuring out 
what I needed to do was very simple, I just had no idea where to start working.
