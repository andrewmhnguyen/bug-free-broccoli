The text of your prompt (“Please input a positive integer: ”) and output strings
(“Flux” and “Bunny”) are stored in the processor’s memory. After assembling your
program, what is the range of addresses in which these strings are stored?
They are stored from 0x10010000 to 0x10010038.

What were the learning objectives of this lab?
The learning objectives of this lab was to teach us the basics of MIPS. In
addition to the basics, like how it runs and works, we also learned how to 
make conditional statements and loops as well.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I did not encounter any issues throughout the lab. Perhaps figuring out how to 
create an else if statement was the hardest part of the lab for me. I found the 
lab overall to be enjoyable, as it allowed me to learn but also was not too 
frustrating to figure out. 

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
If I wanted to redesign the lab, I would consider thinking about adding which 
commands to use in certain cases. Although reading through the textbook covered
all that I needed to know, so maybe it isn't necesarry as it would make things
a lot easier. I don't think there's too much to redesign to make this lab 
better.
