CMPE 012 Fall 2018

-------------------------
What was your design approach?
I started from the simplest subroutine compare_chars. From there, I worked on 
compare_strings and looping through the whole string. After, I worked on 
check_user_input_string and give_type_prompt at the same time.

What did you learn in this lab?
I learned about how to implement the stack and how to implement syscall 8 and
syscall 30. I also learned about subroutines and the implementation of it all.

Did you encounter any issues? Were there parts of this lab you found enjoyable?
I was struggling with what to do to take in user input and what the inputs/outputs
meant in the guide. I was also struggling through looping the strings to compare 
characters. I did find the lab overall to be more enjoyable as it didn't feel like
it was too complicated to figure out.

How would you redesign this lab to make it better?
Add a bit more guidance in the lab on what each function to do.
